# Community Tree Growing Game for Discord

Welcome to the Community Tree Growing Game â€“ a relaxed and enjoyable experience where your community can collaborate to cultivate a beautiful tree right within your Discord server.

## Overview

The Community Tree Growing Game is all about working together to plant and nurture a stunning virtual tree. This laid-back game encourages your Discord community members to contribute towards the tree's growth while fostering teamwork, competition, and a touch of friendly rivalry.

## Features
